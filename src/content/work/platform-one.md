At Platform One, I played a critical role in developing scalable and secure software solutions for Department of Defense (DoD) projects, focusing on frontend development, interactive visualizations, and DevOps integration. Leveraging modern frameworks and methodologies, I delivered applications optimized for performance, usability, and compliance with stringent security standards.

## Project EOS
>Something
- **Frontend Development**: Engineered scalable and responsive Angular applications for Project EOS, ensuring a seamless user experience across classified and unclassified environments.
- **Real-time Data Handling**: Utilized RxJS for reactive data streams, significantly improving the efficiency of real-time user interactions and form submissions.
- **Security and Compliance**: Collaborated with DevOps teams to deploy applications on Platform One, adhering to strict security requirements, including automated scans and Certification to Operate (CtO) processes.
- **Mentorship and Best Practices**: Conducted training sessions for team members on Angular, RxJS, and Test-Driven Development (TDD), accelerating onboarding and improving code quality across the team.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Implemented TDD practices using Jest, increasing test coverage and reducing frontend bugs by 50%, ensuring high-quality and reliable application delivery.

## Project Battle Drill

- **Data Visualization**: Designed and developed interactive data visualizations using D3.js to provide real-time insights into military operations, enhancing decision-making for DoD clients.
- **User-Centered Design**: Worked closely with DoD clients to gather requirements and deliver solutions that met operational needs, improving user adoption and satisfaction.
- **Frontend Documentation**: Managed component documentation with Storybook, standardizing UI elements for scalability and reusability across multiple teams.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved application responsiveness by optimizing frontend performance, reducing load times, and ensuring smooth user interactions even in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Contributions

- **DevOps Collaboration**: Partnered with Platform One teams to ensure seamless application deployment in classified environments, meeting high-security standards with tools like GitLab CI/CD.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Adopted XP methodologies to enhance collaboration and iterative development, resulting in faster delivery of high-quality features.
- **Feature Rollouts**: Implemented feature flagging to enable controlled rollouts and A/B testing, ensuring a seamless user experience during application updates.
