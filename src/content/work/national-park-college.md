At National Park College, I played a pivotal role in transforming the college's web presence by developing and optimizing client-facing web components using Vue.js integrated with the OUCampus CMS. My work delivered robust solutions such as a faculty directory, blog post features, and a wellness tracking system for HR, streamlining workflows and enhancing user experiences for both internal teams and students.

I spearheaded a complete frontend performance overhaul, leveraging tools like Webpack and Grunt to reduce client-side load times by 1400%, significantly improving the site’s responsiveness and usability. The refactoring of the CSS architecture using BEM methodologies, coupled with optimization through Tachyons CSS, reduced CSS file size from 1MB to 30KB, achieving a 97% improvement in efficiency.

To enhance accessibility and search engine visibility, I conducted a comprehensive Lighthouse audit, addressing over 4,200 accessibility issues and elevating the site’s performance rating from a D to an A. These improvements were complemented by optimizing search functionality with Funnelback, which increased search speeds by 90% and made critical resources more accessible for students.

I also implemented automation and standardization across web assets using Style Dictionary, introducing tokenization that allowed instant website updates, reducing changes from days to seconds. This approach enabled faster and more consistent branding updates across the site.

By integrating A/B testing workflows with Google Analytics and Google Optimize, I tailored web content based on user behavior, significantly increasing engagement and conversion rates. These efforts aligned with my focus on delivering responsive, user-centered design solutions that catered to diverse stakeholder needs, from students to faculty and administrative teams.

In collaboration with faculty and HR, I designed intuitive and responsive interfaces, modernizing workflows and improving the efficiency of internal and student-facing tools. My contributions ensured that National Park College’s website was not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance, accessibility, and user engagement, aligning with the institution's commitment to providing a superior educational environment.
