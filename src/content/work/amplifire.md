At Amplifire, I modernized a massive legacy system, enhanced UI/UX design, and implemented robust testing and API optimization. My work improved the platform's performance, usability, and scalability for over 200,000 users.

## Key Projects and Contributions

- **Legacy System Modernization**:
    - Migrated over 1 million lines of legacy Java code to a modern React framework using Remix and React Router.
    - Implemented server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) techniques, reducing load times by 90%.

- **UI/UX Design and Optimization**:
    - Designed and implemented responsive user interfaces using the Chakra UI design system, reducing design inconsistencies by 50% and accelerating feature delivery.
    - Built drag-and-drop interfaces with React Beautiful DnD, improving user efficiency and increasing feature adoption by 15%.

- **Testing and Code Quality**:
    - Led the implementation of Playwright and Vitest, achieving 90% test coverage and reducing production bugs by 50%.
    - Conducted over 50 code reviews monthly, improving code quality by 70% through tools like SonarQube, ESLint, and Prettier.

- **API Development and Optimization**:
    - Engineered consuming REST APIs with Axios, integrating over 50 endpoints to deliver real-time data to users.
    - Optimized API performance, reducing latency by 35%, and enhanced frontend security with Google reCAPTCHA and Zod for data validation, cutting form submission errors by 70%.

- **Collaboration and Documentation**:
    - Partnered with UI/UX teams via Figma, ensuring timely delivery of components and maintaining alignment with design standards.
    - Managed component documentation with Storybook, streamlining the reuse and scalability of frontend components.

- **State Management and Bug Reduction**:
    - Utilized Context API and Jotai for state management, reducing state-related bugs by 30%.
    - Delivered a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture that improved overall user experience and system reliability.

My work at Amplifire combined innovative technology adoption, strategic problem-solving, and collaborative teamwork to deliver a faster, more reliable platform that met the needs of a large and diverse user base.
