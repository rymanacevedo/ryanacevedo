At Amplifire, I led the modernization of a massive legacy Java application, migrating over 1 million lines of code to a modern React framework using Remix and React Router. This transition utilized both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) techniques, reducing load times by 90% for over 200,000 users. My work significantly enhanced the platform's performance, usability, and scalability.

I was instrumental in designing and implementing responsive user interfaces using the Chakra UI design system. This effort reduced design inconsistencies by 50% and accelerated feature delivery, improving overall user satisfaction. Additionally, I built a drag-and-drop interface with React Beautiful DnD, increasing user efficiency and boosting feature adoption by 15%.

A key focus of my role was ensuring robust testing and code quality. By leading the implementation of Playwright and Vitest for frontend testing, I achieved 90% test coverage, which reduced production bugs by 50%. I also conducted over 50 code reviews monthly, enhancing code quality by 70% through tools like SonarQube, ESLint, and Prettier.

To improve API performance, I optimized data delivery with Axios, reducing latency by 35%, and integrated over 50 REST API endpoints to provide real-time data to users. I strengthened frontend security by implementing Google reCAPTCHA and data validation with Zod, cutting form submission errors by 70%.

My contributions extended to collaboration with UI/UX teams via Figma to ensure timely delivery of components, component documentation with Storybook, and the adoption of modern practices like Context API and Jotai for state management, which reduced state-related bugs by 30%. Overall, my work at Amplifire significantly improved system performance, user experience, and development efficiency.
