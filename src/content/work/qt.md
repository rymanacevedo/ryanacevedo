At Qualified Technology, I specialized in creating responsive and customizable WordPress websites tailored to diverse client needs, including a large cabinet door shop, doctors, dentists, and coaches seeking portfolio sites. For the cabinet door shop, I developed an advanced JavaScript-based product configurator, enabling over 10,000 possible configurations and improving the user experience. For medical and coaching professionals, I designed visually appealing portfolio websites that showcased their services effectively while ensuring seamless navigation and accessibility.

In addition to custom website development, I enhanced e-commerce platforms by optimizing user flow and interactivity, leading to a 35% increase in online sales. I also implemented SEO strategies, including custom schema markup and tools like Yoast SEO, improving search engine visibility and driving a 40% increase in organic traffic. By integrating social media features and third-party APIs, I extended website functionality and engagement, providing clients with dynamic, high-performing web solutions that met their unique business goals.
