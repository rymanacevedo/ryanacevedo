*Infra I'm building in 2025*
As I'm starting out 2025, I'm looking to build on top of my already exisiting knowledge of node. I started learning node in 2015 and have been using it ever since. Bun was pretty cool, and I'm looking to work Deno a little more.

There have been some pros/cons of using Deno so far for this simple app I'm building for the organization Second Chance Center.

Take my advice with a grain of salt, but I'm looking to build a simple app that will allow their users to build their own resume.

**Deno**
A lot of people are saying Deno is pretty awesome out of the box. Sadly, I've been having a lot of issues with it. I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to Bun or if it's because I'm not using it correctly. I find myself switching back and forth with npm to run the app. Monorepo setup is the way I go at things which is simple to setup in Bun, but a pain in the ass in Deno.

**React Router (Remix)**
I've been using Remix for a while now, and I'm pretty comfortable with it. I'm looking to build routing in the simplest way possible.

**Hono**
I've just started using Hono, and I'm pretty excited to see how it goes.

**Typescript**
It's Typescript. Duh.

**What's coming up?**
Honestly, it'll be learning to deploy and test the app within the orgnization. I'm looking at the lowest cost possible, but I'm having issues find the "right" deployment platform to do so.

Stay tuned for more updates!
