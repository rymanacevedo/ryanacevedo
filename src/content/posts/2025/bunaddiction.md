# I Have a Speed Addiction...

I’ll admit it: I have a serious addiction to speed. No, not the illegal kind. I'm talking about blazing-fast build times, runtime performance, and bundling. And my enabler? **Bun**.

Bun has become my go-to for everything: build runtime, bundler, package manager—you name it. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of JavaScript tooling, and I’ve been using it as a drop-in replacement for Node.js in all my projects. Sorry, Deno. I gave up on you a while ago.

Today, I’m going to show you how to configure **Cloudflare Workers** to use Bun. Why? I couldn't find any docs on this so I'll make my own.

## Configuring Cloudflare Workers with Bun 🛠️

Cloudflare Workers recently added support for Bun as a build runtime, which means you can now harness its speed and simplicity in your serverless projects. Here’s how to set it up:

### 1. Specifying the Bun Version

First, you’ll want to tell Cloudflare which version of Bun to use. This is done by setting the `BUN_VERSION` environment variable in your Cloudflare Workers project settings.

- Go to **Settings > Build > Build Variables and Secrets** in your Cloudflare dashboard.
- Add a new variable:  
  **Key:** `BUN_VERSION`  
  **Value:** `1.1.33` (or whatever version you prefer).

### 2. Skipping Automatic Dependency Installation

By default, Cloudflare tries to run `npm install` during the build process. But we’re using Bun, so we don’t need that. To skip this step:

- Add another build variable:  
  **Key:** `SKIP_DEPENDENCY_INSTALL`  
  **Value:** `true` (or `1`).

This tells Cloudflare to chill out and let you handle dependency installation yourself.

### 3. Custom Installation Command

Now that you’ve skipped the automatic dependency installation, you can take full control of the process. Use the `bun install` command to install your dependencies lightning-fast.

Here’s what your build command might look like:

#### Build command
```bash
bun install
```

#### Deploy
```bash
bun wrangler deploy
```
Rerun your build and watch the magic happen.

### Before Bun

### After Bun

A 78% increase!
